              <p>A11y 1st was created to be a single resource for software developers to learn about accessibility in web design and development.</p><br>
              <p>As this community grows, we look forward to developers and designers contributing articles and techniques they have learned while attempting to implement accessibility within their designs, pages, and apps.</p><br>
              <p>There are many that believe public awareness is what is needed to make changes on how accessibility is managed on the web. We feel that it should just be the new standard that designers and developers use when building web pages. We don't need to talk about it, we just need to do it.</p>

                <p>WCR Studios is run by Wayne Renbjor. He has worked in software development for over 20 years. He has led many large teams of designers, developers, and QA engineers.</p><br>
                <p>Once he learned about accessibility and how easy it was for a 'Pretty Design' to ruin the experience of using a page for a large part of the population, he knew there had to be a better way.</p><br>
                <p>Working with his teams, many techniques were discovered that can help everyone build a more Accessible Web.</p><br>
                <p>A11y 1st is about providing a community platform for designers and developers to learn and grow. Tutorials, Code, and Conversations will be available as we grow.</p><br>

              <p>We are looking for article writers and code samples! Articles require their own sub folder. Any supported images must be placed in the images subfolder for the article. Supported formats for content are Liquid templates. Supported formats for images is png, jpg, and svg.</p><br>
              <p>Please contact Wayne with an article idea. You will need to submit a new PR for the article, we also prefer that the article lighthouse tests at 95% or above for accessibility. If there is nothing more than texts, images, and links it should test at 100%.</p><br>
