He has lead many large teams of designers, developers, and QA engineers.</p><br /><p>Once he leared about accessibility and how easy it was for a 'Pretty Design' to ruin the experience of using a page for a large part of the population, he knew there had to be a better way.</p><br /><p>Working with his teams, many techniques were discovered that can help everyone build a more Accessible Web.</p><br /><p>A11y 1st is about providing a community platform for designers and developers to learn and grow. Tutorials, Code, and Conversations will be available as we grow.</p><br /><p>If you are looking for an accessible web site or social media management, please visit <a className="is-underlined" href="https://wcrstudios.com">WCR Studios.</a></p>
