# A11y1st - Building the Accessible Web

A11y1st was started to help teach the development community about thinking Accessinility 1st when it comes to their development and designs. There are many ways to accomplish this and there is no one right way. However, there are ways that can be chosen as the way to go for now and if they need to improve, they inprove. 



# We all want to help
A11y1st is not about leading by example or leading from behind. Representation and inclustion is just that, being included. We can all learn from one another. There are no instructers here, only students. Some may have more experience but that by no means reflects a leader and follower dynamic. A11y1st will be available for the community to be involved in. All of our examples will be freely available on Github, all images and content will be Creative Commons licensed for anyone to use.


# Grow with us 
A11y1st comes from the experience of Wayne Renbjor, the owner of WCR Studios (A Marketing and Web Agency) in the South Jersey and Philadelphia area. We are looking for article writers! Articles require their own sub folder. Any supported images must be places in the images subfolder for the article. Supported formats for content is Liquid templates.

Please contact Wayne with an article idea. You will need to submit a new PR for the article, we also prefer that the article lighthouse tests at 95% or above for accessibility. If there is nothing more than texts, images, and links it should test at 100%.
